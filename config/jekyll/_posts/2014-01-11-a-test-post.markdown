================
If you are one of those tech geeks who only want the reason why I shifted to Ruby on rails and jekyll for my personal website, you can skip my sad Flashback story about why It took me a year to complete my portfolio blog. Please remember some points I mention here may not be liked by few but I guess it proves my title. :P


Some Flashback..
--------------

It had been over 2 years since I bought the domain name from godaddy and I had been planning to make my own portfolio website ever since. But Unfortunately time and luck were not at my side by then. I met with a car accident on my Btech 6th semester last written exam day and following 1 month hospitalised with Acute Hepatitis A after the accident, forcing me to miss 1 month class. Due to my university strict rule of atleast 75% attendance for a semester to write exams, I had to attend regular class even with Jaundice in order to save myself from being year back. Yaah 2013 had been a tough year for me.

It was during those tough times when our college was hosting a national level techfest and me and 2 of my friends (Akash and Amal) volunteered to make the college tech fest website. Eventhough after the awesome encouragement and support by Sebastian Sir in our every phase , things were not going as smooth as usual. Since I had already missed 1 month class I wasn't allowed to take duty leave to develop the website from my department. So I had to develop the website with my friends at night and finally we were able to complete the website within 1 week. 

Eventhough 7th Semester was bit busy and all, All I could thinking about was completing my Btech with no backlogs at the end of 8th semster. Even today when I remember about my exams, I can never forget those lovely girls who gave me notes and helped me in my studies during the exams. I am pretty sure I would have been broken apart with backlogs without them. Am saying this because I never studied at my home, all I could think about when I reached home was reading new stuffs online, chating in freenode and I don't know why but I always got a good freelance work during my University exams :v . Usually I start studying for an exam during evening on the night before exam and most of the time I just read the notes once and I go to college early on the exam day and ask girls to run me through the notes. This study method had helped me a lot during my btech as I had to spend less time on studies and also managed to get average marks. But again its not always so, there had been times when I didnt even study a bit till morning and scored good marks and also a time where I studied a lot and scored very less.

Again to the fact that why I didnt want Backlogs during my last year of Btech was mainly due to 2 main factors. First one is as simple as it is , "I hate exams" and I cant think of restudying the same subject again next year. There are certain subjects in Electronics that can sweat even the best students if not handled with care, some of it includes AET, Microwave, RP, etc which are like the FM & AMM of Mechanical engineering. Maybe its because the portions of these subjects were vast and bit difficult to understand in one go and to ease up the difficulty the university had been bit . 

Anything else apart from completing my btech exams in time for applying for higher studies.

Bloggy was born when [Zach](http://zbruhnke.com) was bored while his girlfriend and her sister were talking and watching the voice.

So this gem was created to generate a blog inside my rails application for a blog post I wrote while working at [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com).

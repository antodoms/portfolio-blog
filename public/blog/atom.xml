&lt;p&gt;Some Flashback..
................&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been over 2 years since I bought the domain name from godaddy and I had been planning to make my own portfolio website ever since. But Unfortunately time and luck were not at my side by then. I met with a car accident on my Btech 6th semester last written exam day and following 1 month hospitalised with Acute Hepatitis A after the accident, forcing me to miss 1 month class. Due to my university strict rule of atleast 75% attendance for a semester to write exams, I had to attend regular class even with Jaundice in order to save myself from being year back. Yaah 2013 had been a tough year for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was during those tough times when our college was hosting a national level techfest and me and 2 of my friends (Akash and Amal) volunteered to make the college tech fest website. Eventhough after the awesome encouragement and support by Sebastian Sir in our every phase , things were not going as smooth as usual. Since I had already missed 1 month class I wasn&#39;t allowed to take duty leave to develop the website from my department. So I had to develop the website with my friends at night and finally we were able to complete the website within 1 week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventhough 7th Semester was bit busy and all, All I could thinking about was completing my Btech with no backlogs at the end of 8th semster. Even today when I remember about my exams, I can never forget those lovely girls who gave me notes and helped me in my studies during the exams. I am pretty sure I would have been broken apart with backlogs without them. Am saying this because I never study at my home, all I could think about when I reach home is reading new stuffs online, chating in freenode and I don&#39;t know why but I always get a good freelance work during my University exams :v . Usually I start studying for an exam during evening on the night before exam and most of the time I just read the notes once and I go to college early on the exam day and ask these girls to run me through the notes. This study method had helped me a lot during my btech as I had to spend less time on studies and also managed to get average marks. But again its not always so, there had been times when I didnt even study a bit till morning and scored good marks and also a time where I studied a lot and scored very less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything else apart from completing my btech exams in time for applying for higher studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggy was born when &lt;a href=&quot;http://zbruhnke.com&quot;&gt;Zach&lt;/a&gt; was bored while his girlfriend and her sister were talking and watching the voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this gem was created to generate a blog inside my rails application for a blog post I wrote while working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineyard.com&quot;&gt;Engine Yard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gem Updated 1/11/2014 with improvements for newer version of Jekyll and rake generate fix&lt;/p&gt;
